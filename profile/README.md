Trilemma Foundation is a nonprofit and Canadian registered charity that incubates technical talent through global university partnerships, open-source collaboration, and performance-based opportunities. Since our inception, we have worked with over 80 universities worldwide that serve as hubs for discovering, engaging, and empowering top technical talent.

Our mission is to help the brightest minds rise based on performance.

To support this mission, we operate as a data-driven R&D lab. We explore bold ideas, build tools, and run open-source projects that provide hands-on experience to anyone with internet access. This structure creates positive externalities such as job placements, data-driven innovation, startup development, and broader ecosystem impact by putting talent first.
