Trilemma Foundation is a non profit and Canadian registered charity that incubates technical talent through global university partnerships, open source collaboration, and performance based opportunities. Since our inception, we have worked with over 80 universities worldwide that serve as hubs for discovering, engaging, and empowering top technical talent.

Our mission is to enable the brightest minds to rise based on performance.

To support this mission, we operate as a data-driven R&D lab. We explore bold ideas, develop tools, and run open source projects that provide hands on experience to anyone with internet access. This structure allows us to generate positive externalities such as job placements, data-driven innovation, startup development, and broader ecosystem impact by focusing on talent first.
