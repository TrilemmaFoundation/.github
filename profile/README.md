Trilemma Foundation is a Canadian registered charity that empowers technical talent through global university partnerships, open-source collaboration, and performance-based opportunities. Since our inception, we’ve worked with 80+ universities that serve as hubs to engage and support talent worldwide. Our mission is to enable anyone with an internet connection to demonstrate their technical ability in a transparent and verifiable way.

This structure allows us to operate as an R&D lab, where we test bold ideas, learn from setbacks, and explore sustainable models to maximize impact.
